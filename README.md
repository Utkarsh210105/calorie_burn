Calories Burnt Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the number of calories burned based on various factors, using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on data that includes details such as exercise Duration, Age, Weight, and Intensity of the activity, which are known to influence calorie burn rates. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we can better understand relationships between these factors and caloric output.

The project consists of the following main steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: First, we organize the data in a structured CSV format, ensuring it is clean and ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations like box plots, histograms, and scatter plots, we identify patterns and check data distribution. This step helps to visualize the correlation between activity parameters and calories burned.
Model Training: With machine learning libraries, we apply a Linear Regression model, training it on the prepared data to predict the target variable, Calories Burnt.
Evaluation: We assess the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) to ensure its predictive accuracy.
By the end, this model provides insights into the impact of various exercise parameters on calories burned, which can be useful for fitness enthusiasts and trainers to design effective workouts.
